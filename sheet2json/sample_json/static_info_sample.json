The abortion itself usually takes less than 15 minutes, but between checking in, waiting, talking to counselors and providers, taking any medications, the procedure, and recovery time, the whole thing can take several hours—or even a whole day. You will likley have blood drawn and an ultrasound. The pregnancy is removed or expelled through your cervix, which is the natural opening to your uterus where your menstrual blood comes out.",
